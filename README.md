# Portfolio Website 2.0

Re-built my portfolio website with up-to-date information and a brand new UI and color scheme inspired by Control.

Concept/Initial Design: [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/vc0X3Ac304bfmafgbPxs7q/Portfolio-Overhaul?node-id=0-1&t=rvDnUlqppmzppFBR-1)

## Description
Simple portfolio website that has my resume, about section, experience, projects, and a contact section! This website is much more animated than my previous one and features more links for projects alongside a new contact section that sends emails to me using EmailJS. Also there's now a light/dark mode toggle.

## Reason for Overhaul
Ran into an issue with my previous portfolio, where adding new projects or experiences was cumbersome, since it was basic HTML and CSS, with some light JavaScript.

To remedy these issues, I decided on using React for its resuable components and added a separate `data` folder that contains all descriptions and links for projects and experiences using TypeScript interfaces, so I can easily add new entries much faster. So, instead of copy and pasting code, I can simply add a new element to an array and accomplish the same thing.

I also decided to use Tailwind CSS and React to develop the project quickly, since I wanted to overhaul it before a career fair, and chose TypeScript for code maintainability and organization.

## Tech Stack
- React (Vite)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
